SEMANTIC_MATCH_PROMPT = """
You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to determine if the ACTUAL response is
semantically equivalent to the EXPECTED response.

QUESTION: {question}

EXPECTED RESPONSE: {expected}

ACTUAL RESPONSE: {actual}

Evaluate if the ACTUAL response conveys the same meaning and information as the
EXPECTED response. Minor differences in wording are acceptable as long as the core
meaning is preserved.

Respond with a JSON object:
{{
    "score": <float from 0.0 to 1.0>,
    "reasoning": "<brief explanation of your evaluation>"
}}

Score guidelines:
- 1.0: Perfect semantic match, all key information preserved
- 0.8-0.9: Minor differences but core meaning intact
- 0.5-0.7: Partial match, some key information missing or different
- 0.2-0.4: Significant differences but some overlap
- 0.0-0.1: Completely different or contradictory
