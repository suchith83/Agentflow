"""Conversation goals criterion (UserSimulator only).

Evaluates whether goals were achieved across a full multi-turn
conversation transcript produced by ``UserSimulator``.

.. important::

    This criterion is designed **exclusively** for use with
    ``UserSimulator``.  The simulator sets ``actual_response`` to the
    complete conversation transcript (all turns).  In the normal
    ``AgentEvaluator`` flow, ``actual_response`` contains only the
    agent's final response, so this criterion would not see prior turns.

The LLM judge receives the full transcript and a list of goals, then
checks whether each goal was addressed at any point during the
conversation — not just in the final message.
